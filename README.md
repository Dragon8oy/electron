# Mollusc Text Editor
 - Molluc text editor is a small Electron project, made to learn some JavaScript and some other technologies
 - It's not intended for daily use at all, it's just a bit of fun :)
 - Credit in part to [/u/hobbit_lamp](https://www.reddit.com/user/hobbit_lamp) for the application's icon
 - This project is largely unmaintained, and is only occasionally updated for security patches, but maybe I'll revisit it one day?
