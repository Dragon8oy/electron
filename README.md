# Mollusc Text Editor
 - Molluc text editor is a small Electron project, just for fun, to learn some JavaScript and some other technologies
 - It's not intended for daily use at all, it's just a bit of fun :)
 - Credit in part to [/u/hobbit_lamp](https://www.reddit.com/user/hobbit_lamp) for the application's icon
 - This project has been archived, as I don't have many plans for it at the moment, maybe I'll revisit it another day :)

# Running:
 - `npm run start`

# Building:
